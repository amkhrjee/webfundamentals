# TCP Slow Start / 14kb Rule 
The first response packet will be 14Kb. This is part of TCP slow start, an algorithm which balances the speed of a network connection. Slow start gradually increases the amount of data transmitted until the network's maximum bandwidth can be determined.

TCP slow start helps buildup transmission speeds to the network's capabilities. It does this without initially knowing what those capabilities are and without creating congestion. TCP slow start is an algorithm used to detect the available bandwidth for packet transmission, and balances the speed of a network connection. It prevents the appearance of network congestion whose capabilities are initially unknown, and slowly increases the volume of information diffused until the network's maximum capacity is found.
